    <h2>Braised shortribs</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>4 4 oz beef short ribs (dry brined for a day if you can)</ul>
    <ul>1 cup of wine (I used Pinot Gregio because I like it, and someone had to drink the rest of the bottle. I would suggest a similar selection method because any wine should work here)</ul>
    <ul>2 cups stock (I used store bought and cheated by adding about a couple teaspoons of plain gelatin, but your own veal stock would be ideal)</ul>
    <ul>1 Tbsp tomato paste</ul>
    <ul>10 peppercorns</ul>
    <ul>Half stalk celery</ul>
    <ul>Half a carrot</ul>
    <ul>Small onion, rough chopped</ul>
    <ul>4 cloves of garlic, peeled and smashed with the flat of your knife</ul>
    <ul>5 sprigs fresh thyme</ul>
    <ul>Bay leaf</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>In a hot dutch oven, sear off your ribs and set aside.</ol>
    <ol>Turn heat to medium low and sweat the onions with some salt and pepper until soft and translucent.</ol>
    <ol>Add tomato paste and garlic, cook for another couple min.</ol>
    <ol>Deglaze pot with the wine, add your stock, meat, more salt (careful; here too much salt will cause issues down the line as you're going to reduce the braising liquid by 3/4 or more later), and everything else, then bring to a simmer and transfer to an oven that's preheated to around 250 for 2-2.5 hours, until meat is tender.</ol>
    <ol>Check after a few min to make sure its at a simmer and adjust the oven temp if you need to, then prep your other ingredients and go do some other shit.</ol>
    <ol>Remove the meat from the liquid and set aside in some foil to stay warm.</ol>
    <ol>Strain the liquid through a sieve, and set aside.</ol>

    <h2>Sauce</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>1lb Crimini Mushrooms, cleaned and sliced medium thick</ul>
    <ul>1/4 cup wine</ul>
    <ul>1 Medium onion (cut in half root to stem and sliced 1/2" thick the same direction.)</ul>
    <ul>2 Cloves garlic minced </ul>
    <ul>Braising liquid</ul>
    <ul>3tbsp butter (...ish? Just have a stick of butter handy)</ul>
    <ul>2 tsp dijon mustard</ul>
    <ul>Worchestershire sauce</ul>
    <ul>1.5 to 1 cup heavy cream</ul>
    <ul>1 sprig fresh thyme</ul>
    <ul>1/2 a bunch of flat leaf parsley</ul>
    <ul>Sour cream</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>In a large skillet, brown your mushrooms with butter salt and pepper, 2 batches seems to go faster for me, and set aside.</ol>
    <ol>Add the onions to the pan and brown them with butter, salt and pepper.</ol>
    <ol>Add the garlic and thyme, and cook for another minute or two.</ol>
    <ol>Deglaze with the wine, then add the braising liquid and reduce until it starts getting "saucy" in texture.</ol>
    <ol>Add the mushrooms back to the pan along with the cream and reduce by about half, until saucy as well (This will thicken as it cools so allow for this).</ol>
    <ol>Add salt, pepper, the dijon, and worchestershire to taste.</ol>
    <ol>You can now add the meat that you've removed from the bone and sliced to be bite sized, to the mixture and stir everything together.</ol>
    <ol>Remove freom heat, add a tbsp of cold butter, the parsley, and a small dollop of sour cream before spooning over rice, mashed potatoes, or (as pictured) buttered egg noodles.</ol>
